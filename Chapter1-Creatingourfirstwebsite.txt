We start building a website by creating a file named (index.html)
index.html is a special filname whch is presented when the website root address is typed.

***A Basic HTML page***
<!DOCTYPE html> -- Specifies this is an html5 doc
<html> -- root of an HTML page
<head> -- Contains page metadata
<title> Aditya website </title> --Contains title
</head>
<body> -- the main body of the page
<h1> this is a heading </h1> -- heading tag
<p> My paragraph </p> -- paragraph tag
</body> -- closing body tag
</html> -- closing html tag

IMP Notes
-Head & Body tags are childern of HTML tag.
-HTML is the parent of head & body tags.
-Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening & closing tags.
-Some HTML tags have no Content.These are called Empty Elements eg.<br>
-We can either use .htm or .html extension
-you can use"inspect Element" or "View Page Source" option from chrome to look into a website's HTML code.

     HTML element= Start Tag + Content + End tag

***Comments in HTML***
Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be paresd.They cna help document the source code.
<!--HTML Comment-->

***Case Sensitivity***
HTML is a case insensitive language <H1> and <h1> tags are the same.
