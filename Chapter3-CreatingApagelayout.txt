When we use the right tag in right place,it results in a better page layout,better indexing by search engines and better user experience.
We use the following tag to get the job done.

<header>
<main>
<footer>

Inside the main tag we insert the following tags:

<main> -- The main opening tag
<section> -- A page section
<article> -- A self contained content
<aside> -- Content aside from the content(rg.ads etc)
</main> -- The main closing tag

creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable & structured layout.
Also they are useful for SEO.

***Link Attributes***
<a herf="/content">Contact Us</a>
<a herf="/content" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>

We can put any content inside an anchor tag(images,heading etc are all allowed)

If the page is inside a directory ,we need to make sure that we link to the correct page
