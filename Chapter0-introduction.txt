HTML--Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is the language of the web.It is used to create websites.
We use HTML tags to define look & feel of website.
With understanding of these tags and how to put them together,we can create beautiful websites easily!

**Then Why CSS & JavaScript**
HTML is used for defining layout of a page-A bakebone page structure

CSS is used to add styling to that backbone page created using HTML

JavaScript is used to program logic for the page layout eg.What happens when a user  hovers on a text; When to hide or show elements etc.

***A beautiful analogy***
HTML==Car body(only metal)
CSS==Car paint,decoration etc.
JavaScript==Car engine+Interior logic
